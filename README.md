# K-means & Hierarchial Clustering in R
a) K-means is a unsupervised learning method which is used to group similar types of data points together also referred as clustering groups. 
b) In K-means, grouping is based on the mean distnace between the points. The distance metric could be Euclidean or Manhattan distance etc.
c) For this project, I am using Wine data from the UCI archive (this is a very commonly used data set in ML).
d) In the attached R-script, I am using function "SimpleKMeans" from package "RWeka" to perform Clustering Analysis.
e) The clustering analysis is being done using both Euclidean and Manhattan distance.
